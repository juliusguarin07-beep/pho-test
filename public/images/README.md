# Logo Files

Place your logo files in this directory:

## Recommended Logo Files:
- `pangasinan-logo.png` - Main logo for the system (recommended: 200x200px or larger)
- `pangasinan-logo.svg` - Vector version (optional, for crisp scaling)

## Usage:
The system will automatically use your logo from:
- `/images/pangasinan-logo.png`

## Fallback:
If the logo file is not found, the system will display a default SVG icon instead.

## Format Recommendations:
- **PNG**: For photos/complex images with transparency
- **SVG**: For simple vector graphics (best for logos)
- **Size**: At least 200x200px for good quality on all screens
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square or rectangular logos work best
